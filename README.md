#  nb.binterpolate~ #

nb.binterpolate~ is a spectral audio effect external for [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max). It takes an FFT signal as input and interpolates between successive values of each FFT bin measured at different times. 

Requires the [Max SDK](https://cycling74.com/downloads/sdk) to compile. 

A standalone Mac application featuring nb.binterpolation~ is available [here](https://www.naithan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BinterpolationDemo.zip).

A copy of the external, compiled for Mac, is available [here](https://naithan.com/max/).
